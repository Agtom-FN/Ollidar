# Owner design-review feedback (running log)

## 2026-08-16 — round 1 (verbal, against mockup v3)
1. **Android · Capture**: display settings are too narrow to operate — needs large-touch-target treatment (bottom sheet).
2. **Desktop (macOS + Windows) · Capture**: start-record / end-record buttons missing — must be prominent.

### Resolution — 2026-08-16 (mockup v4)
1. **Fixed.** Capture's display strip is now a Material bottom sheet: a 48 px Display button
   floats on the viewport; the sheet is 65 % tall with scrim, grabber, 20 px top radius,
   40 px colour chips and 44 px slider rows with 28 px knobs. Colour / point size / LOD bind
   live to `S.cap.*` and repaint the canvas without re-rendering, so the viewport stays
   visible and verifiable above the sheet. Closes via grabber, scrim, Esc or Done.
   Checklist: `a-cap-disp` reworded; `a-cap-sheet` and `a-cap-view` added.
2. **Fixed.** Desktop capture has a record cluster pinned under the viewport on both shells:
   Test device → **Start recording** (large ember pill) → Pause/Resume → **Stop recording**
   (red-tinted) with a ticking elapsed clock and a REC/PAUSED/ARMED badge. Start stays
   disabled until the self-test passes and states the threshold in words.
   Checklist: `d-cap-rec`, `d-cap-start`, `d-cap-gate`, `x-reccluster` added.

Verified headless via CDP: 60/60 assertions, zero console errors, no dead controls
(87 actions audited across every screen). Screenshots: `redesign-exports/fix-*.png`.

## 2026-08-16 — round 2
3. **Android · Capture**: move the AR setting into the Display bottom sheet — view mode (3D/AR) belongs with the display settings, not as a separate floating control.

### Resolution — 2026-08-16 (mockup v5)
3. **Fixed.** The floating 3D/AR segmented control is gone from the capture viewport. View mode
   is now the **top section of the Display sheet**: a full-width, 48 px-tall segmented row —
   two equal halves, **3D orbit / AR overlay** — above colour mode, point size and LOD. It is
   bound to the same `capView` action and `S.cap.view` state as before, so nothing was
   re-plumbed; `capView` just got the in-place treatment the colour chips already had: it
   patches `aria-pressed`, the row read-out and the *AR tracking* line behind the sheet, then
   `redraw()`s. The viewport swaps to the camera-anchored AR backdrop live, with the sheet
   still open and un-jumped. The Display button is now the single entry point for view +
   display settings; the **Orbit / Follow** camera control stays on the viewport, untouched,
   and desktop capture keeps its own `dcapView` control.
   The sheet grew 65 % → 73 % with tightened row rhythm (12 px) so all four rows still fit
   above the fold with no scrolling, while 77 px of live viewport stays on screen above it —
   enough that the AR swap is plainly visible (mean band brightness 14 → 38).
   Checklist: `a-cap-ar` rewritten to the new location (and to assert the overlay control is
   gone), `a-cap-sheet` reworded to "single entry point for view + display settings, ~70 %
   height", `a-cap-disp` now lists the 48 px View row first, `a-cap-view` extended to cover
   view mode. No items added or removed — still 110. No dead controls or orphan handlers:
   `capView` remains referenced (from the sheet), and no `data-act` was left behind.

Verified headless via CDP: 44/44 round-2 assertions plus the full round-1 suite re-run green
(60/60) — 104 total, zero console errors, zero uncaught exceptions, 87 actions audited across
every screen with the sheet both open and closed, and a record → AR-toggle → stop cycle driven
end to end. Screenshots: `redesign-exports/fix-r2-*.png`.

## 2026-08-16 — round 2 clarification
3b. **Clarified**: "AR setting" = the **ARCore + camera keyframes** controls (colorization capture), not the view-mode toggle. The Display sheet must include an "AR & Camera" section: camera-keyframes on/off (+ rate), AR tracking status. View row from 3a stays unless owner objects.
